# BitCoin-Miner

How to run the code
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will require Java version of lower than 1.8, i.e Java verion 1.7 or lower.

You need to have sbt as well.

There are two folders namely Server and Client.

You need to go into the directories of these two folders using CD command.

#For Standalone command i.e scala Project1 5

You need to go into the Server directory (where build.sbt is located ) and then type sbt in the command prompt.

Then you should write compile in the sbt shell.

After that you should type run 5 in that.

Then you will get all the bitcoins with 5 leading zeroes.

#For Remote

You need to open Server folder on one machine and Client folder on another machine.

Then do the same process as above.

Run the Server first, do run 5.

Then do run (IP of server ) on the client machine.
